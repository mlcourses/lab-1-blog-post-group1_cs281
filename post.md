# Lab X: Doing stuff with hardware!

Please write a blog post describing your lab here.

This is just an example of how you might structure your blog post, feel free to edit as you wish. For example, you might divide the lab into different sections each with their own intro, instructions, results, and takeaways. Please see the rubric for details on how the post will be evaluated.

## Overview and Motivation
This week we'll explore digital circuits and the hardware we will be using in this course. We will be introduced to PB-503 breadboard prototyping stations and about the Arduino, which is a a microcontroller system for supporting embedded processor control. We will understand how to work with circuit components such as LEDs, resistors and logic gates built into ICs.
